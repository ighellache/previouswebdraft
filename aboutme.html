                    <!--<ul></ul> -->
                        <li>I graduated in Biological Sciences with a 2.1 Upper Second Class Honours, from the University of Leicester.</li>
                        <li>I've worked as a coding tutor alongside my university studies, having introduced children to coding with minecraft and scratch to teaching them to code in python.</li>
                        <li>I have completed my dissertation on a bioinformatic analysis on experimentally difficult 'TUF' regions in the human genome, using python. </li>
                        <li>I'm interested in advancing and current technology, healthcare and looking to combine the two one day.</li>
                        <li>I've competed in lacrosse for 2 years.</li>
                        <li>I like to draw.</li>
                        <li>I can speak and understand english (native), french (fluent), spanish (professional), arabic (basic), and I've picked up a few words in japanese.</li>

                    <h1>Why I want to apply for the programme</h1>
                        <p>I want to apply for the programme because I have taken great interest in programming, and feel that an intensive short term course is more ideal for me, in terms of learning more about the tech field; rather than completing a masters in it. Furthermore, I appreciate that this programme encourages peer programming and collaboration, as different ideas are bought together I feel most supported that way. It also would keep me engaged as it would simulate the working world, where I would be encouraged to share my ideas with new people, practise teamwork and meet deadlines under pressure.</p>
                        <p>I aspire to be a web developer because I enjoy how I can combine creativity with logical thinking. The skills required in this role is also increasingly high in demand, as the world continues to advance with technology. Therefore, becoming a web developer would allow me to showcase other companies' businesses, raise awareness to something, provide services online, educate others on a variety of topics - the opportunities are endless.</p>
